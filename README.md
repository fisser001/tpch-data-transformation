# tpc-data-transformation
This repository contains the Apache Spark code for transforming the third normal schema data from the TPC-H framework into the star schema and denormalized schema. 

For the transformation a Spark job has been implemented which can be find under the following path: /src/main/scala/com/masterarbeit/scala/transformation/TransformationJob.scala

The has code has been executed locally without a Spark cluster. Therefore, the IntelliJ IDE has been used to execute the code locally on a notebook.
